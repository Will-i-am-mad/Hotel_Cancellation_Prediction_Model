[Project Purpose] The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting hotel cancellation rates using a range of independent variables. Afterward, we can deploy this machine learning model to empower businesses with the ability to make informed decisions, leading to the reduction of cancellations and the optimization of customer satisfaction levels.
